// like Firefox or Chromium (puppeteer) or M$ Outlook (for some shitty reason)
// create class instance of an environment you are using

// Firefox and Chrome
// IE and EDGE will be opened on a dedicated vm, because well... fuck you that's why
// and that's all folks! No Safari for now, because I don't have a mac
// Maybe I should get one
